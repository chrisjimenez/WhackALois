Whack-A-Lois README
==================================================================

This is my version of Whack-A-Mole, called Whack-A-Lois! This is basically a family guy version of whack-a-mole, where Lois is the mole and Stewie is the hammer. Your objective is to basically hit Lois as much as you can in 30 seconds. More info on gameplay can be seen below. This assignment was a bit easier than assignment #3 because of the use of OOP, since I borrowed some code from that assignment. However, it was difficult getting some of the sound and images because they were either too long, if they were sound clips, or to large, if they were images. So any kind of media that was used had to be reconfigured for Processing. This took up most of the time, but it was fun picking out some hilarious images and sounds.
