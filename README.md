# Whack-A-Lois 

This is my version of Whack-A-Mole, called Whack-A-Lois! This is basically a family guy version of whack-a-mole, where Lois is the mole and Stewie is the hammer. Your objective is to basically hit Lois as much as you can in 30 seconds. More info on gameplay can be seen below. This assignment was a bit easier than assignment #3 because of the use of OOP, since I borrowed some code from that assignment. However, it was difficult getting some of the sound and images because they were either too long, if they were sound clips, or to large, if they were images. So any kind of media that was used had to be reconfigured for Processing. This took up most of the time, but it was fun picking out some hilarious images and sounds.

### Background
The first thing I did was set up the background for the start-up screen and the background during gameplay. I got the startup screen image online, but I changed it up a little bit and included the whack-a-lois title. I found the family guy font online, so I downloaded it and used it for the title.


### Characters
All the characters were found online and resized to fit with the game. The hammer image is a combination of a hammer image, pow image, and stewie. Here are some of the images:

### Sound
I got most the sound clips online, but I had to cut out a few of them from longer mp3 files. 

### Gameplay
As mentioned, the game is simply a family guy version of whack-a-mole. Your objective is to hit lois as much as you can. Every time you do, you get a point. You have to do this as much as you can under 30 seconds. 

When Brian pops up, you get 2 points instead of 1, since Stewie probably hates Brian as much as he hates Lois. If Bertram, Stewies enemy, pops up and you hit him, you lose a point. The original game has sound(pretty hilarious too) but unfortunately that version of the game is unplayable online.
