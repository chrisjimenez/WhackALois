# Whack-A-Lois 
This is my version of Whack-A-Mole, called Whack-A-Lois! This is basically a family guy version of whack-a-mole, where Lois is the mole and Stewie is the hammer. Your objective is to hit Lois as much as you can in 30 seconds. More info on gameplay can be seen below.

### Background
The first thing I did was set up the background for the start-up screen and the background during gameplay. I got the startup screen image online, but I changed it up a little bit and included the whack-a-lois title using a family guy font I found online.

### Characters
All the characters were found online and resized to fit with the game. The hammer image is a combination of a hammer image, pow image, and stewie image.

### Sound
I got most the sound clips online, but I had to cut out a few of them from longer mp3 files. 

### Gameplay
As mentioned, the game is simply a family guy version of whack-a-mole. Your objective is to hit Lois as much as you can. Every time you do, you get a point. You have to do this as much as you can under 30 seconds. 

But there are "special" moles that have their own rules when you hit them:
-When Brian pops up, you get 2 points instead of 1, since Stewie probably hates Brian as much as he hates Lois.
-If Bertram, Stewies enemy, pops up and you hit him, you lose a point. 

The original game has sound but unfortunately that version of the game is unplayable online.
